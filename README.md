# Data-preprocessing-using-titanic-machine-learning-dataset-1
This project was done using Titanic machine learning dataset.I downloaded the dataset from kaggle.Then I performed different data preprocessing task like finding missing values,filling the missing value,extracting informations,removing unnecessary features,Transforming columns,data visualization.At last  I predicted the output using random forest classifier model.
